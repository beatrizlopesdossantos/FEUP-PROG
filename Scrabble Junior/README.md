# Second Project - Scrabble Junior :video_game:

The game consists in the two programs: Scrabble Junior & Board Builder.

The Board Builder fulfills the project's requirements, creating a txt file with the proper board file format.
Besides the board size and the validation of the words, using the WORDS.TXT file, this program gives the user full freedom to build the perfect board. 
The created board is saved in the current directory if no directory is provided when asked and, if missing, ".txt" is added to the file's name.

The Scrabble Junior program follows the rules of the following link: "https://www.hasbro.com/common/instruct/Scrabble_Junior.pdf".
